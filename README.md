Application For saving SMS to Firestore database in the background

## Why I build it
 	- I am a student, and for any purchase online I have to ask OTP from my father. So I build an app so that I don't need to ask for any OTP it will directly save into my database and I can see it from there. ðŸ˜Š

## How it works
    - Connect Project with your firebase project
    - Install this app and  login
    - Manually give permission of SMS
    - Now Just wait for the OTP ðŸ˜‚

## Note
 	- This app is not built for hacking or any illegal purpose
 	- As I build it for my father's mobile and install it with his permission.
